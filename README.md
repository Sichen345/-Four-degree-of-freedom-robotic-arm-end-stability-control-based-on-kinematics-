This is a matlab demo about four-degree-of-freedom robotic arm end stability control, based on kinematics. I referred to this link and modified the code in it: 
https://github.com/ChehabiMed/inverse-kinematic-4-dof-robot-arm. 
You can also refer to this project and find out some details about the mathematical thoughts behind the code.
